      <h1>Cricket üèè</h1>
<p>Cricket is a globally celebrated sport that originated in England and is now immensely popular across Asia, Australia, the UK, and parts of Africa. It is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players on a large, oval-shaped field with a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch at the center.</p>
<p>The game has multiple formats, ranging from traditional five-day Test matches to fast-paced Twenty20 (T20) games, making it versatile and appealing to a wide audience. The sport emphasizes teamwork, strategy, endurance, and skill.</p>
<p>Each team takes turns batting and fielding. The batting team tries to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets, while the fielding team aims to limit runs and dismiss the batters through various methods like catches, run-outs, or bowling them out.</p>
<p>Popular cricket tournaments include the ICC Cricket World Cup, Indian Premier League (IPL), The Ashes (England vs Australia), and T20 World Cup. Legends like Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, M.S. Dhoni, Ricky Ponting, and Jacques Kallis have left an indelible mark on the sport's history.</p>
<p>Cricket fosters a deep sense of national pride and camaraderie, often uniting diverse communities under a shared love for the game.</p>
